41414819,OR198,,Echo in FL,Dog,Dogue de Bordeaux,no,Adult,F,XL,altered,hasShots,housetrained,"Hello, hello, hello…my name is “Echo”, 
I’m 3 years old. My brother, “Draco”, and I came to Dogue de Bordeaux Rescue or DDBR of no fault of our own. I am very attached to my brother and we would love to be adopted together. I am a very sweet and shy gal. I like to do everything my brother does. It makes me sad when he goes somewhere without me. I love attention and for someone to scratch my belly. I also love going for walks early in the day or later in the afternoon/evening when it’s not terribly hot outside, I walk very well on a leash and never pull. I am gentle with taking food from your hand and will not take food unless it is offered to me. I like to chew on bones but I have never learned to play with toys. I would like it if you could teach me! I am a fast learner and aim to please my owner. I also love long naps and car rides. I am a full time inside dogue only as us dogues don’t do particularly well in the heat for long periods of time – I do love to romp around outside with my brother but only for short supervised durations. The vet says I am in good health however I do have a broken tail from an accident when I was a puppy – the vet states it does not hurt me however I prefer it not be touched. I have been spayed and am up to date on my shots. I have a microchip and take my Trifexis every month year round like a good girl. I came from a family with (2) small children so my brother and I are likely good with children and, unlike my brother, I’m also well-mannered around other dogs.  
My brother and I have been living in boarding facilities (a cage) in Central FL since April 4th and are very much in need of a foster home until able to be adopted. DDBR states they may have the ability to arrange transport outside of the state. If you have been on the fence about fostering, now is the time to just do it! DDBR has been trying to find help for us for a while and is dedicated to saving me and my brother but they cannot do this without some assistance.

Completed application and reference/home check required. Standard adoption fee is $450 applies to all of our rescues. We do NOT ship or fly rescues as it’s too stressful on them. 

If you are interested in any of our rescues, please complete our adoption application, it can be completed on line. Further information and questions, please contact Laurie at roscoberner@gmail.com

Donations are always needed to help with rescue dog expenses. Your tax deductible donations are greatly needed and appreciated.

at the Pet Supermarket 2449 S. Hiawassee Rd. Orlando 32835

LuLu was found by the State Troopers in Tn. She was seen running back and forth on the highway by people going to work. LuLu would often sit by the median watching the cars go by. 
Lots of people called in about her. You see there was snow on the ground and it was cold in the Tn Mountains.
When the Troopers went out to get her, she ran and they followed. She led them right to her den with her litter of sweet babies. She showed them where she had hidden them and kept them safe. Lulu was happy to be rescued with her puppies by the kind deputies. In no time at all, they were bathed and snuggled in a warm bed at the Dr. Hood Memorial Shelter. Well ... that was some time ago. The babies have all been adopted and Mom is just waiting for you to take her home. 
LuLu is a little bit picky. She loves people but would do best in a home where she is the one and only. 
If you have room in your heart and home for this big beautiful girl, Please call us. We would love to meet you., and LuLu is waiting just for you.

 These dogs and puppies come to us thru the efforts of multiple rescue groups from a high kill shelter up north. .

Hi!

My name is Chessie. I am a beautiful black silky, shiny kitten with golden eyes and just a little tiny white spot on my chest! My foster mommy found me at her greenhouse. I'm not really sure how I got there. But I'm very sweet and
love
️ to be petted! I'm a little shy at first but once I warm up to you, I will be your best friend! I get along fine with other kitties and hope to find my forever home soon! I love to play with that little red dot that comes out of that little laser pointer you have in your hand! That is my favorite toy!

Will you give me a forever home and love me and care for me? I will love you forever!

Thank you for your interest in one of our adoptable kitties. All of our kitties are fully vetted (age-appropriate vaccines, spayed, tested for feline leukemia and feline aids, and they are microchipped.) They live in private foster homes with their foster families. Our adoption fees are $75 - $125.

In order to match the best home for our foster kitties, we ask folks to complete our adoption application in advance; simply go to www.candyscats.org/forms. You will need to register on our site, and then fill out an Adoption Application. We'll review your information and get back in touch with you.

Est. birthday 6/01/2008

Zorrita, which means ""little fox"" was trapped in 2009 with her kitten which was added to another litter. She used to be very feral and she could not be approached. Her kitten was socialized fully vetted and found a furever home. Zorrita was then also spayed and vetted and stayed outside and was taken care of. She did well with the other kitties so her rescuer decided to bring her inside. She has lived with her foster family for about 9 yrs. Over time with love and care from her foster family she will let you cautiously pet her and will even let you rub her tummy. As soon as you do she will slowly start to purr!!! She is very food motivated and will loudly meow when it's time for her food. Zorrita looks like a mini Maine

Coon

mix and loves to have her long hair brushed. She is fearful of strangers at first so it's best she is socialized in a space where she cannot hide in or under something. We know that with time and patience this beautiful girl will come around. She actually does fine with other kitties that are calm and cat friendly but at this point would most likely be best as an only kitty. She just needs that special someone who can give her plenty of time to get acclimated and understand that she needs and wants love but just has to earn your trust. She deserves to live out her senior years in a warm and cozy furever home where she can receive all the love she so deserves.

Piccata, (KJ), 7-10-17 Male

Hi, my name is Piccata! My siblings and I were eating out of the dumpster of a chicken restaurant. My foster mommy brought us to her home and got us healthy and named us after chicken dishes! I am a sweet little light orange tabby boy who is just looking for his forever home. I’m a little shy at first, but once I get to know you I will love you! I also love to play and snuggle!Would you consider giving me a forever home?

This very petite sweet 1 year old Calico kitty was rescued with her 5 babies along with a large group of other kitties from a homeless camp in Orlando.
